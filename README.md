Employee Retention Analysis
Project Overview

This project explores patterns and insights in employee retention using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to understand factors influencing employee turnover, identify trends, and provide actionable recommendations for HR and management teams to improve retention rates.

The analysis focuses on variables such as employee demographics, tenure, job satisfaction, department, salary, and promotion history to uncover patterns that correlate with whether employees stay or leave.

**Key Business Questions**

Which factors most strongly influence employee retention?

Are there departments, roles, or employee demographics with higher turnover risk?

How does tenure, promotion history, or salary correlate with employee retention?

Are there actionable insights that HR can use to improve employee engagement and reduce attrition?

**Methodology**

**Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and ensured data consistency.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
Visualized distributions of key variables (age, salary, department, satisfaction, etc.)

Analyzed correlations between employee characteristics and retention

Identified trends in turnover by department, tenure, and promotion frequency

Insights Extraction: Highlighted patterns that HR can leverage for proactive retention strategies.

**Key Insights**

Employees with short tenure or lack of promotions have higher turnover rates.

Certain departments or roles experience higher attrition compared to others.

Job satisfaction and salary are significant predictors of retention.

Trends suggest that targeted engagement programs and promotion planning can improve retention rates.

**Tools & Technologies**

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)

Jupyter Notebook for EDA

GitHub for version control

**Next Steps / Recommendations**

Use predictive modeling to forecast employee attrition risk.

Implement employee engagement and career development programs in high-turnover departments.

Regularly monitor key HR metrics (satisfaction, promotions, tenure) to detect early signs of attrition.

Explore deeper statistical analysis or machine learning approaches for retention prediction.
